/**
 * “Morra” is a hand game that has many variations and can be played by two or
 * more players.
 * 
 * In this variation of the game, one player is going to be the “Odds” player
 * and the other player “Evens”. In each round of the game, the players will
 * simultaneously "hold out" between 1 and 10 fingers. The winner of the round
 * is decided based on the sum of ﬁngers shown by both players. If the sum is an
 * even number, then the “Evens” player wins; otherwise, if the sum is an odd
 * number, then the “Odds” player wins. The winner of the round receives two
 * points.
 * 
 * In addition, the player whose number of fingers is closer to the sum,
 * receives one extra point.
